# mp4ToLVFconverter
Well, I had a mental breakdown coding this shit

## How to use
To actually run this you obviusly need to have python 3 installed. Then just click on installcv.bat, wich will install opencv-python
wich is the libarie I use. When everything is ready you open up a console window, navigate to the converters directory and use the command `python converter.py <path to mp4 file> <resulting filename>`. The converter will then do it's thing.
